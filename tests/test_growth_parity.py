"""Growth, evolution and graduation, against the Swift balance table.

The constants are copied from CompanionModel.swift and checked here value by
value, because a number that drifts changes the game silently — nothing fails,
the Pokemon just takes a different amount of work. The order of the checks in
`apply_usage` is tested too: that ordering is load-bearing, and getting it
wrong put the wrong species in the Pokedex.
