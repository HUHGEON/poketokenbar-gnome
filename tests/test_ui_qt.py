"""The Qt front end, actually constructed and fed a real payload.

Qt runs offscreen, so unlike the GNOME extension this one can be built and
exercised here: every panel is instantiated, handed the output of a real
`state.build`, and asked to lay itself out. That does not prove it looks right,
but it does prove every widget constructs, every field it reads exists, and no
code path raises on the shapes the daemon actually emits.

The empty-state cases matter as much as the full ones. Most people install this
before the daemon has ever written a file, and a front end that raises on
`None` is one that never gets as far as showing anything.
