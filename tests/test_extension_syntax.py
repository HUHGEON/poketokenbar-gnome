"""The extension's JavaScript parses, and its manifest is well formed.

GNOME Shell reports a syntax error only in the journal, after the extension has
already failed to load, so a stray character survives right up until someone
tries it on a real desktop. Node parses the same ESM grammar GJS does, which is
enough to catch that class without a Shell.

It is a parse check, not a run: nothing here proves an actor renders or that a
GNOME API exists. What it does mean is that a typo cannot reach a release.
