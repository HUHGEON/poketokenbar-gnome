"""The suite must not be able to reach anything it did not create.

This is a guard on the conftest fixture rather than on any one module. Without
it the default paths resolve under the real home: `save.default_path()` becomes
the developer's own `~/.local/share/poketokenbar/companion.json`, a test that
builds a CompanionStore without a path loads it, and a test that persists writes
over it. That is not hypothetical — running the suite on the machine this was
developed on replaced the companion someone was raising with a test fixture, and
nothing failed.

Every default the project has is checked, because the next one added will
default the same way.
