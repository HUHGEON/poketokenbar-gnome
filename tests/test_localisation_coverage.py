"""Nothing user-visible escapes the catalogue.

Setting the language to Korean left parts of the app in English more than once,
and each time it was found by looking rather than by a test: the settings page,
then the tray menu, then the shop and the bag, then every Pokemon's nature.
The pattern is always the same — a string that lives somewhere other than
`l10n`, so translating the app translates everything around it.

These tests look for that shape directly instead of for the individual strings.
