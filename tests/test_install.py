"""install.sh — the paths it copies, and the names it copies them under.

The script itself was run end to end in a container and does what it says. What
survives here are the parts that rot: a directory renamed in the repo, or a
uuid that stops matching, neither of which shows up until someone installs and
finds nothing enabled. Re-running pip and venv on every test run would buy
nothing those two checks do not already cover.
