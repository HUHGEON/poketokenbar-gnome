/* framecap.js — the sprite arithmetic, kept away from the Shell.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any gi:// import so it can be run and tested outside a
 * Shell. These are the pieces of sprite handling with an algorithm rather than
 * an API call, and the places a plausible-looking version is wrong.
 *
 * Two of them: how long a loop is (`loopLength`) and how many of its frames get
 * drawn (`capFrameRate`).
 *
 * The second ports GIFDecoder.capFrameRate. The rule that matters: **decimate, do not
 * hold.** Raising each frame's own delay to the floor keeps every frame and
 * stretches the whole loop — upstream measured a Gen-V sprite (55 frames x
 * 0.05s = 2.75s) turning into a 22s loop at a 0.4s floor, an eighth of the
 * intended speed. Dropping frames instead keeps one loop the same length as
 * the source and only lowers how many frames it is drawn with.

// of a frame is a recomposite, and a sprite that never stops asking for one
// keeps the machine awake. "saver" is the default for the same reason.

 * Where a decoded sequence starts over, or 0 when it never does.

 * GdkPixbuf hands out frames forever — its iterator wraps round at the end of
 * the animation rather than stopping — so the decoder has to recognise the wrap
 * itself. One repeated frame is not evidence enough: a sprite returns to the
 * same pose several times per loop, and cutting at the first repeat of frame
 * one throws most of the animation away. Lombre's idle is 112 frames and comes
 * back to its opening pose at frame 33; only the run of frames after the repeat
 * tells the two apart.
 *
 * `digests` is one comparable value per frame, in order.
