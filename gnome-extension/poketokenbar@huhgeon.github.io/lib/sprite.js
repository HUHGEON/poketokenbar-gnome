/* sprite.js — animated Gen-V sprites as Shell actors.
 *
 * The Plasma port got this for free: QML's AnimatedImage plays a GIF directly.
 * St has no equivalent, so the frames are decoded with GdkPixbuf and swapped on
 * a timer, which is what the macOS app does with ImageIO.
 *
 * Cheap on purpose. A Shell extension runs inside the compositor process, so a
 * frame swap here is a local content assignment with no IPC — but a leaked
 * timer is a leak in the compositor, which is why every actor stops its own on
