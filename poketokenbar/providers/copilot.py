"""Copilot CLI usage — ports the Copilot half of LocalAdditionalUsageProvider.swift.

One row per billed API call in `~/.copilot/session-store.db`, subagent calls
included: those are separate requests, not a copy of the parent turn, so unlike
Grok's session logs there is nothing here to exclude.

The accounting fault this reader exists to avoid: `input_tokens` is the *whole*
prompt, with cached reads and writes as a subset of it. Adding the columns as
they stand triples every cached prompt, so the cached parts are subtracted back
out. `reasoning_tokens` is likewise a breakdown of `output_tokens`, not an extra
charge, and is ignored.

Costs are not reported: Copilot bills subscription premium requests, not
per-token dollars, so a dollar figure here would be invented.

Timestamps arrive in two shapes — the CLI writes ISO-8601 with a `Z`, while the
column default (`datetime('now')`) writes `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in UTC — and a
row may carry a UTC offset. All three are normalised to the same instant.
