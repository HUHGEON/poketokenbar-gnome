"""Provider extension point — ports UsageProvider.swift.

Adding a source means adding an implementation and a PROVIDERS entry. Never
branch on a provider id in shared code; see docs/reference/provider-extension.md.

`ScanningProvider` holds the half of that contract every file-scanning source
repeats: walk roots, parse each file (through the mtime/size cache), dedup, then
aggregate into today / week / month. Subclasses supply only what actually
differs — `roots()` and `parse_file()`.

The aggregation lives here rather than in each provider on purpose. Upstream's
extension rule is that general totals must be provider-agnostic, and the first
two ports had already drifted: Codex reimplemented `fetch_daily` and never grew
a `fetch_periods` at all, so its week and month silently read zero.
