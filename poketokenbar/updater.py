"""Updating in place, without reinstalling.

The macOS app checks GitHub releases and then hands the job to Homebrew, or
opens the release page. Neither exists here — an install is a copied source
tree beside a venv — which makes the update simpler rather than harder: fetch
the tree, check it, swap the directory, restart.

Nothing here touches the save, the config or the sprite cache. They live
outside the install root precisely so that replacing the code cannot lose a
Pokedex, and this is the moment that promise has to hold.
