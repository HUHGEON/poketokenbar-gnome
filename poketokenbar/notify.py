"""Desktop notifications, by whatever route this platform offers.

Cosmetic throughout: a failure is swallowed, never surfaced as an error, and
never allowed to interrupt a poll. That is also why the backends are tried in
order and a missing one is not a problem — the alternative is a tracker that
stops counting because it could not post a toast.

    Linux    notify-send (libnotify)
    macOS    osascript
    Windows  PowerShell, via the shell's own toast API

Windows has no equivalent of notify-send and no notification tool that ships
everywhere, so the toast is raised through PowerShell, which does. It is slower
than the other two — a process start of a few hundred milliseconds — but this
runs a handful of times a day, on hatches and limit crossings.
